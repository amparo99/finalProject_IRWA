In order to run the search engine it is necessary to write the number of tweets you want as top (top-k).
Then the type of score is:
1 -- For tf-idf score
2 -- For our score taking into account the popularity 
And finally is necessary a query.
The folders are distributed of the following form:

                          --- scrapper.ipynb
other-outputs --- outputs of the different research questions
